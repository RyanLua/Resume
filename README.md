# Personal Resume

My academic resume, which I wrote in LaTeX entirely from scratch on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Designed to be minimal and easy to maintain.

Inspired by [Rover Resume](https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume) and "[How to write a LaTeX class file and design your own CV](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_write_a_LaTeX_class_file_and_design_your_own_CV_(Part_1))".
